#### Next Steps (icebox):
•	I want to add a weather API to my website. 
•	I want to make it so moms can upload photos of their trip with their comments.
•	I want to have a chat section where mothers could chat with each other about tips and tricks. 
•	I want to organize the tips in tricks by tips so if the tip has to do with flying there would be a page for flight tips and so on.
